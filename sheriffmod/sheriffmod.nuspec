Q&A
---

**Can you play Proximity Chat (Crewlink) with it?** Yes Crewlink does
support Among Us Modifications.

**Can you get banned for playing on public Servers?** At the current
state of the game there is no perma ban system for the game. The mod is
designed in a way, that it does not send prohibited server requests. You
are also able to join your own custom server to be safe
[(Impostor)](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor)

**How can i join a custom server?** Go to your game directory and open
BepInEx/config/org.bepinex.plugins.SheriffMod.txt. There you can set the
hostname or IP of the server. Then set the server region to CUSTOM.

**Do my friends need to install the mod to play it together?** Yes.
Every player in the game lobby has to install it.
